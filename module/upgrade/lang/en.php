<p>Dear users, ZenTao has made adjustments to navigation and concepts since version 15. The main changes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<p><li>Added the concept of program. A program set can include multiple products and multiple projects.</li></p>
<p><li>Subdivided the concept of project and iteration, a project can contain multiple iterations.</li></p>
<p><li>The navigation adds a left menu and supports multi-page operations.</li></p>
</ol>
<br/>
<p>You can experience the latest version of the function online to decide whether to enable the mode: <a class='text-info' href='http://zentaomax.demo.zentao.net' target='_blank'>Demo</a></p>
</br>
<p><strong>How do you plan to use the new version of ZenTao?</strong></p>

<p>Next, we will migrate the previous historical product and iteration data to the project set and under the project, with the following scenario for migration.</p><br />
<h4>Option 1: Product and iteration organized by product line </h4>
<p>It is possible to migrate the entire product line and its following products and iterations into one project set and project, although you can also migrate them separately as needed.</p>
<h4>Option 2: Iteration of product-based organizations </h4>
<p>You can select multiple products and the iterations below them to migrate to a project set and project, or you can select a particular product and the iterations below it to migrate to a project set and project.</p>
<h4>Option 3: Independent iterations </h4>
<p>Several iterations can be selected to migrate to a single project set, or independently.</p>
<h4>Option 4: Iterations linked to multiple products.</h4>
<p>These iterations can be selected to fall under a new project.</p>
